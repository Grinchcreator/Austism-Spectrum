# Austism-Spectrum
A project about Autism Spectrum (ASD)

So I decided to practice on something new which doesn't involve much JS but mostly focuses on adapting the pages for mobile devices.
The site gives insight on ASD, its causes, statistics etc. Also it gives a chance to make a donation to a real organisation (it gives a link to the form).
I don't own the information provided, there are links to the real owners. The site is created for raising awareness towards ASD.
