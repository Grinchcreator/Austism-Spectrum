 <h2> Challages and Causes</h2>
 <p> <ul>
 <li>Children born to older parents are at a higher risk for having autism. </li>
 <li>Parents who have a child with ASD have a 2 to 18 percent chance of having a second child who is also affected. </li>
 <li>Studies have shown that among identical twins, if one child has autism, the other will be affected about 36 to 95 percent of the time. In non-identical twins, if one child has autism, then the other is affected about 31 percent of the time.  </li>
 <li>Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. </li>
 </ul>
